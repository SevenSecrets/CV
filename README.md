### Project Greenprint (Makers Final Project)

My final project at Makers, in which my team and I created a web app which measures and tracks the amount of carbon users
produce through their travel. The frontend was built in React and the backend in Node and Express, using MongoDB to store
user data. We also worked extensively with various APIs, including elements of the Google Maps API suite.

### Telegram Weather App

A personal project built in Ruby which uses the Telegram Bot and Climacell APIs to send the user information about the weather
including temperature, precipitation, and UV index. The server is built in Sinatra and the app is hosted on Heroku and tested
with Rspec.

### Game Suggestions

A React app in which users can look up and create a poll out of games from IGDB (a database of games with an API), then vote
on them in order to help a group decide on what to play together.
