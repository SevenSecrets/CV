## Freddie Smith Hughes

Recent graduate of software development bootcamp Makers Academy. I have been interested in programming and
development since I was a teenager, beginning to build games when I was 13, in addition to formal training. Iâ€™m passionate
about using cutting-edge technology to help people in practical ways, and to constantly improve my own technical knowledge.

## Skills

#### Experienced Researcher
Having studied History at university, I am experienced in research. Switching career paths into software development has meant
utilising those skills in a new way.

#### Dedicated Learner
Changing my focus to software development has made it necessary to learn quickly and practically, on the job. I am good at
picking up new skills and technologies through hands-on experience of building new projects.
