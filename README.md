## Freddie Smith Hughes

Recent graduate of software development bootcamp Makers Academy. I have been interested in programming and
development since I was a teenager, beginning to build games when I was 13, in addition to formal training. Iâ€™m passionate
about using cutting-edge technology to help people in practical ways, and to constantly improve my own technical knowledge.

## Skills

#### Experienced Researcher
Having studied History at university, I am experienced in research. Switching career paths into software development has meant
utilising those skills in a new way.

#### Dedicated Learner
Changing my focus to software development has made it necessary to learn quickly and practically, on the job. I am good at
picking up new skills and technologies through hands-on experience of building new projects.

## Experience

#### FullFact (April 2015 to March 2015) 

Volunteer - During the 2015 Election campaign I maintained and set up most of the hardware in the offices of Full Fact, the factchecking organisation. I set up a system written in Python to parse live subtitles on news broadcasts and helped manually
gather data from live broadcasts in order to help fact-check election coverage.

## Projects

### Portfolio

My personal portfolio, where I have links to some of my projects which I think would be of interest to people. Built as a single page app in React.

### Project Greenprint (Makers Final Project)

My final project at Makers, in which my team and I created a web app which measures and tracks the amount of carbon users
produce through their travel. The frontend was built in React and the backend in Node and Express, using MongoDB to store
user data. We also worked extensively with various APIs, including elements of the Google Maps API suite.

### Telegram Weather App

A personal project built in Ruby which uses the Telegram Bot and Climacell APIs to send the user information about the weather
including temperature, precipitation, and UV index. The server is built in Sinatra and the app is hosted on Heroku and tested
with Rspec.

### Game Suggestions

A React app in which users can look up and create a poll out of games from IGDB (a database of games with an API), then vote
on them in order to help a group decide on what to play together.

### Greenprint Mobile

The mobile app for Project Greenprint which I built after graduating in order to extend the project and teach myself about React
Native and mobile app development. Uses the original Greenprint backend.

## Hobbies

#### Game Development
- I enjoy game development as a hobby, which was what originally got me into programming as a teenager, beginning with Flash, and nowadays using Unity.

#### Cybersecurity
- I take part in CTFs (Capture the Flag) such as [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) online for fun and to help me practice cybersecurity skills, especially web security.

#### First Aid and Community Care
- I am First Aid trained, with a focus on mental health, as part of working with a community care and first aid collective which is focused on helping vulnerable LGBT+ people.
